                <h2>UMSI Peer Tutoring Program</h2>
                <p>In partnership with UMSI faculty, the UMSI Peer Tutoring Program offers students the chance to receive academic assistance and support in UMSI courses from their peers. This program is designed to create a collaborative learning environment where students can engage with peer tutors who have excelled in the same courses. Peer tutors provide guidance, clarify concepts, and offer valuable insights that can help you understand difficult topics in ways that may resonate more effectively than traditional lectures.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whether you’re grappling with complex theories or need help with specific assignments, UMSI Peer Tutors are here to help you strengthen your understanding and succeed in your courses.</p>
